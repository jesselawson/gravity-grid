# Gravity Grid

An open-source puzzle game in Java/LibGDX for Android devices where you move planets around a grid so that their total "gravity score" equals the gravity requirements of the system they're in.

## A complete game

Gravity Grid is a complete, working, [published game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turkey.gravitygrid) on the Google Play store. It was entirely designed and developed by me as a way to test whether I can rapidly learn Java, LibGDX, and Android development. 

I open-sourced this game because I want people to be able to learn from my strengths and mistakes.
